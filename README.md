This project is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

It is part of the "The Odin Project" portfolio; made in the Foundations Course.

Once completed, it will demonstrate basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS, putting the focus on DOM manipulation.

The steps to follow are:

1. Set up a Git repository for the project.

2. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.

3. Set up a "hover" effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a trail through your grid like a pen would.

4. Add a functionality to let the user change the number of squares per side for the new grid.
